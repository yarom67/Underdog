# Walkthrough - Underdog Race Landing Page

I have successfully built the landing page for "Underdog", a race for dogs with disabilities.

## Accomplishments
- **Project Setup**: Initialized Next.js 15 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and Framer Motion.
- **Design System**: Configured a vibrant, accessible color palette (Amber/Blue/Teal) and modern typography.
- **Assets**: Generated custom high-quality imagery for the hero and features sections.
- **Components**:
    - `Hero`: Dynamic entrance with cinematic background.
    - `About`: Mission statement with smooth scroll animations.
    - `Features`: Grid layout highlighting the inclusive nature of the event.
    - `Registration`: CTA section with decorative elements.
    - `Navbar` & `Footer`: Responsive navigation and site links.

````

## Verification
- **Build**: `npm run build` passed successfully.
- **Linting**: No critical lint errors (minor warning about `@theme` in CSS due to new Tailwind v4 syntax).
- **Responsiveness**: Components are designed with mobile-first Tailwind classes (`md:`, `lg:` breakpoints).

## Next Steps
- Connect the registration form to a backend or service.
- Add a "Stories" page to feature individual dogs.
